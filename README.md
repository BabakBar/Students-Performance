# Students-Performance
Executive summary report for students performance at two subjects using R &amp; decision tree approach.
The objective of this analysis is to predict the student academic results and to suggest a set of strategies, or actions for the schools.
The data approach student achievement in secondary education of two schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features.
In this executive report we conducted a brief, yet accurate analysis on the data sets using a decision tree in order to find the most influential variables on the final grade of each student. 
The models have described an obvious relationship between most recent test score, G2, but has also identified
the fatherâ€™s job, Fjob, as being a useful indicator which may not have been revealed in a human expert
analysis. Based on this first findings, the school can take initial action by offering extra tutoring to students
who have received a poor grade in G2. In addition the influence of the fathers job can be checked further to
find additional correlations to aid students based on their circumstances.
